      <h1>Problem 17 - Number letter counts</h1>
      <p>If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 =
        19
        letters used in total.</p>

      <h3>If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would
        be
        used?</h3>
      <p><small>NOTE: Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters
          and
          115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance
          with
          British usage.</small></p>
